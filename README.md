# Diabetes Data Analysis: Data Insights

A comprehensive SQL project analyzing diabetes data.

## Objective
This project leverages SQL and data analysis skills to explore a dataset of individuals. The dataset includes variables such as:
1. `EmployeeName`
2. `Patient_id`
3. `gender`
4. `D.O.B`
5. `hypertension`
6. `heart_disease`
7. `smoking_history`
8. `BMI`
9. `HbA1c_level`
10. `blood_glucose_level`
11. `diabetes`

The aim is to analyze and derive insights into various aspects such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, family history of diabetes, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and laboratory test results. This analysis will facilitate a deeper understanding of diabetes risk factors and support effective data-driven decision-making.

## Project Details
The SQL assessment includes the following tasks:
1. **Retrieve Patient Information**: Retrieve `Patient_id` and ages of all patients.
2. **Filter by Age and Gender**: Select all female patients older than 40.
3. **Calculate Average BMI**: Compute the average BMI of patients.
4. **Blood Glucose Levels**: List patients in descending order of blood glucose levels.
5. **Hypertension and Diabetes**: Find patients with both hypertension and diabetes.
6. **Heart Disease Count**: Determine the number of patients with heart disease.
7. **Smoking History Analysis**: Group patients by smoking history and count smokers and non-smokers.
8. **BMI Comparison**: Retrieve `Patient_ids` of patients with a BMI greater than the average BMI.
9. **HbA1c Levels**: Find the patient with the highest and lowest HbA1c level.
10. **Calculate Patient Age**: Calculate the age of patients in years, assuming the current date.
11. **Rank by Blood Glucose**: Rank patients by blood glucose level within each gender group.
12. **Update Smoking History**: Update the smoking history of patients older than 50 to "Ex-smoker."
13. **Insert New Patient**: Insert a new patient into the database with sample data.
14. **Delete Patients**: Delete all patients with heart disease from the database.
15. **Find Patients with Specific Conditions**: Find patients with hypertension but not diabetes using the `EXCEPT` operator.
16. **Unique Constraint**: Define a unique constraint on the `patient_id` column to ensure its values are unique.
17. **Create View**: Create a view displaying `Patient_ids`, ages, and BMI of patients.

## Methodologies
1. **Data Retrieval and Manipulation**:
   - **SQL Queries**: Used SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and manipulate patient data, including retrieving patient IDs, filtering by age and gender, and calculating average BMI.
   - **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated data to analyze patterns, such as grouping patients by smoking history and counting smokers and non-smokers.
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **BMI and HbA1c Analysis**: Calculated average BMI, identified patients with BMI greater than the average, and found patients with the highest and lowest HbA1c levels.
   - **Blood Glucose Levels**: Ranked patients by blood glucose levels within each gender group and listed patients in descending order of blood glucose levels.
3. **Database Management**:
   - **Updating Records**: Updated smoking history for patients older than 50 and inserted new patient records with sample data.
   - **Deleting Records**: Removed patients with heart disease from the database.
4. **Data Integrity and Schema Design**:
   - **Unique Constraints**: Defined a unique constraint on the `patient_id` column to ensure data integrity.
   - **Schema Improvements**: Suggested improvements to the database schema to reduce data redundancy and enhance data integrity.
5. **Advanced SQL Techniques**:
   - **Creating Views**: Created a view to display `Patient_ids`, ages, and BMI of patients for easier access and analysis.
   - **EXCEPT Operator**: Utilized the `EXCEPT` operator to find patients with hypertension but not diabetes.

## Actionable Insights and Recommendations
1. **Health Risk Identification**:
   - **Diabetes and Hypertension**: Identified a high-risk patient group with both diabetes and hypertension, enabling targeted interventions and preventive care strategies.
   - **High BMI**: Patients with above-average BMI should be closely monitored for obesity-related risks and provided with personalized lifestyle modification programs.
2. **Targeted Interventions**:
   - **Smoking History**: Update smoking status for patients over 50 to "Ex-smoker" to ensure accurate health records and customize health recommendations.
   - **Heart Disease**: Prioritize regular health check-ups and preventive measures for patients diagnosed with heart disease due to its critical nature.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**:
   - **Ranked Analysis**: Utilize ranked blood glucose and HbA1c levels to identify patients requiring urgent medical attention or follow-up care.
   - **Gender-Based Analysis**: Examine gender-specific health metric variations to develop tailored health programs addressing unique needs.
4. **Database Enhancements**:
   - **Schema Improvements**: Implement database normalization, indexing, and primary key-foreign key relationships to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Query Optimization**: Apply advanced SQL query optimization techniques to enhance data retrieval speed and overall analysis efficiency.
